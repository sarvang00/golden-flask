Lets make a mini-project in golang

1. We will scrap the a mp3 audio site; taking input of https url as input.
2. Later phase: try to download mp3 and set them to a folder.

Amendment: We donot plan to scrap to full site and perform mapping (maybe later?). 
Instead, we will keep the url such that we will just parse through the url input given
in CLI and store it at the location specified.
